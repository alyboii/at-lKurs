    "# 🔄 Cross-Validation: The Truth Serum for Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Cross-Validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models. instead of testing the model once (Train/Test Split), we test it multiple times on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use it?\n",
    "1.  **More Reliable:** It proves the model is not just \"lucky\" with the data split.\n",
    "2.  **Utilizes All Data:** In simple splitting, the Test data is never used for training. In CV, every row is used for both training and testing at different times.\n",
    "3.  **Detects Overfitting:** If the model varies wildly between folds (e.g., 90%, 60%, 85%), your model is unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Common Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "* **Concept:** Split data into **K** equal bins (folds).\n",
    "* **Process:** Train on $(K-1)$ folds, Test on the remaining 1 fold. Repeat $K$ times.\n",
    "* **Best for:** Regression and general datasets.\n",
    "* **Visual:**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    [Test] [Train] [Train] [Train] [Train] -> Score 1\n",
    "    [Train] [Test] [Train] [Train] [Train] -> Score 2\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    Average Score = (Score 1 + ... + Score 5) / 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Stratified K-Fold\n",
    "* **Concept:** Same as K-Fold, but it preserves the **percentage of samples** for each class.\n",
    "* **Example:** If your data is 90% \"No\" and 10% \"Yes\", every fold will also be 90/10.\n",
    "* **Best for:** **Classification** (especially imbalanced data like Fraud Detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Leave-One-Out (LOOCV)\n",
    "* **Concept:** K = Number of Rows. We test on exactly 1 row.\n",
    "* **Pros:** Uses maximum amount of training data.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Very slow (Computationally expensive).\n",
    "* **Best for:** Very small datasets (e.g., < 100 rows).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Quick Guide: Which `cv` value to pick?\n",
    "* **cv=5** or **cv=10**: The industry standard. Good balance of speed and accuracy.\n",
    "* **cv=3**: If your data is huge (millions of rows) and 10 folds would take too long.\n",
    "* **LOOCV**: Only if you have very little data (Medical/Biology research)."
