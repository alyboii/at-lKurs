    "# 🚀 Regression Models Encyclopedia: Which One Should I Choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Science, there is no \"Single Best Model.\" You must choose the right weapon for the battle. Here is your complete guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Basic Models (No Punishment)\n",
    "The goal of these models is simply to minimize the **Error** (Residuals). They do not care if the math gets complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "* **The Logic:** \"One Input, One Output.\" Draws a straight line.\n",
    "* **The Formula:** $$y = b_0 + b_1x$$\n",
    "* **Real World Example:** Predicting a child's **Height** based ONLY on their **Age**.\n",
    "* **When to use:** When you have a single feature and the relationship looks straight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "* **The Logic:** \"Many Inputs, One Output.\"\n",
    "* **The Formula:** $$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n$$\n",
    "* **Critical Rule:** You MUST use **StandardScaler**! Otherwise, big numbers (Salary: 50,000) will dominate small numbers (Age: 30).\n",
    "* **Real World Example:** Predicting **House Price** based on *Size, Location, Floor, and Age*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3. Polynomial Regression\n",
    "* **The Logic:** \"The world is curved, not flat.\" We use powers ($x^2, x^3$) to capture curves.\n",
    "* **The Math:** It is actually Multiple Regression, but with engineered features:\n",
    "  $$y = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + b_3x^3$$\n",
    "* **The Risk:** If you choose a high Degree (e.g., 10), the model will **Overfit** (memorize the noise).\n",
    "* **Real World Example:** **Temperature Prediction**. It is cold in the morning, hot at noon, and cold at night. A straight line fails here; you need a \"U\" curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Regularization Models (The Punishers)\n",
    "If your model is **Overfitting** (memorizing), we add a \"Penalty\" to the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **💡 The Philosophy:** \"You can make a model, but you are NOT allowed to use huge coefficients (weights). Keep it simple.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 4. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) - \"The Volume Control\"\n",
    "* **How it works:** It shrinks the coefficients (weights) towards zero, but they never reach exactly zero.\n",
    "* **The Penalty Math:** Adds $$\\lambda \\sum (\\text{slope})^2$$ to the Error equation.\n",
    "    * Because we **square** the slope, large numbers (like 10,000) get a **huge** penalty. The model is forced to pick small numbers.\n",
    "* **Best For:**\n",
    "    * When you want to keep ALL your features.\n",
    "    * When you have **Multicollinearity** (duplicate features like \"Age in Years\" and \"Age in Months\").\n",
    "* **Analogy:** In a loud meeting, you don't kick anyone out, but you turn down everyone's volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 5. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization) - \"The Mute Button\"\n",
    "* **How it works:** It shrinks coefficients all the way to **Zero (0)**. It effectively deletes useless features.\n",
    "* **The Penalty Math:** Adds $$\\lambda \\sum |\\text{slope}|$$ to the Error equation. (Absolute value).\n",
    "* **Best For:**\n",
    "    * **Feature Selection:** When you have 1000 columns but suspect only 10 are important. Lasso will delete the other 990.\n",
    "* **Analogy:** In a meeting, you kick out the useless people. Only the important speakers remain.\n",

    "| Model | Complexity | Risk of Overfitting | Math Penalty | Handling \"Trash\" Columns | Best Use Case |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Simple/Multiple** | Low | Low (Underfitting?) | None | Uses everything | The starting point for any project. |\n",
    "| **Polynomial** | High | **Very High** | None | Uses everything | When data is clearly **curved** (Non-linear). |\n",
    "| **Ridge (L2)** | Medium | Low | **Squared ($Slope^2$)** | Shrinks them (0.01) | When data is noisy or features are correlated. |\n",
    "| **Lasso (L1)** | Medium | Low | **Absolute ($|Slope|$)** | **Deletes them (0.0)** | When you have too many columns (Feature Selection). |\n",

    "* **If Too Many Columns:** `Lasso(alpha=0.1)`\n",
